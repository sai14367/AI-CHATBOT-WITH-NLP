## 📘 Project Description

This project is focused on building a basic AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the help of libraries like NLTK and spaCy. The chatbot is designed to simulate conversation with users, answering queries based on pre-trained language models and defined intents. It serves as a practical introduction to NLP and chatbot development for educational and prototype-level use cases.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Conversational AI has become essential in enhancing user engagement across various domains such as customer service, education, and healthcare. However, building a chatbot from scratch can be overwhelming for beginners. This project simplifies that process by using Python and NLP libraries to create a rule-based chatbot capable of responding to common queries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the fundamentals of NLP and chatbot design
* Train a chatbot on basic intents using Python libraries
* Tokenize, normalize, and analyze input text
* Generate appropriate responses based on user input
* Provide a script-based chatbot with basic interaction capabilities

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* Text-based interaction with users via the terminal
* Predefined intents and responses for common conversation flows
* Text processing using tokenization, lemmatization, and classification
* Uses NLTK for language preprocessing and text similarity
* Easily extendable with new intents and responses

---

## 📚 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.7+**
* **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) for NLP
* **spaCy** (optional for enhanced NLP features)
* **JSON** (for defining intents)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_Chatbot_NLP.git
cd AI_Chatbot_NLP
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install nltk

## 🔢 Example Intents (in `intents.json`)

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
      "responses": ["Hello! How can I help you?", "Hi there, what can I do for you?"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "goodbye",
      "patterns": ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye"],
      "responses": ["Goodbye!", "See you soon!"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "thanks",
      "patterns": ["Thanks", "Thank you"],
      "responses": ["You're welcome!", "Glad I could help!"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧠 NLP Components Used

* **Tokenization**: Splitting user sentences into words
* **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root form
* **Bag-of-Words Model**: Representing text as numerical data
* **Intent Matching**: Determining the user’s intent from their message

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Cases

* 🧑‍🏫 **Education**: Students can explore NLP concepts hands-on
* 💬 **Customer Service Simulation**: Simple automated support chatbot
* 🧠 **NLP Learning**: Demonstrates text preprocessing and classification
* 🤖 **Prototyping**: Quick demo for AI assistant concepts

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

* Understand NLP building blocks using NLTK and spaCy
* Learn how to structure JSON files for chatbot intents
* Implement a rule-based chatbot using Python
* Gain exposure to tokenization, lemmatization, and classification
* Learn to handle user input and generate responses

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Rule-based only; not trained on deep learning models
* Cannot handle complex or ambiguous queries
* No web or GUI interface
* Responses are static and predefined
* Limited understanding of context or memory

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Use Transformer-based models like BERT or GPT
* Add GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit
* Allow speech input/output (voice interaction)
* Use a database to store conversation history
* Implement deep learning with TensorFlow or PyTorch
* Deploy chatbot as a web service using Flask or FastAPI
